# Product dashboard design
This website is a prototype that shows how a smart tool can help a business understand its customer reviews. It's designed to be simple and powerful, turning feedback into clear, easy-to-read information.

1. The Home Page
The home page is the first thing people see. Its main goal is to look professional and show what the product can do.

Great Design: It has a bold, modern look with a dark theme, like the one from osmo.supply. This makes it look clean and professional.

Easy to Understand: The page is split into different sections (like "Features" and "How It Works") with cool images. This makes it easy to quickly understand what the product is all about.

Clear Buttons: Big buttons like "Get Started" and "Start Free Trial" are easy to find and guide people on what to do next.

2. The Dashboard
The dashboard is where the magic happens. It's the main part of the website and turns data into useful information.

AI-Powered Ideas: This is the best feature. The dashboard doesn't just show you data; it uses AI to give you actionable steps to solve problems. For example, if many reviews mention "slow" delivery, the AI can suggest a plan to fix it.

Interactive Visuals: The dashboard is not a static page. You can see a bar chart that shows how people feel about different parts of your product. You can also click on words in a word cloud to get more details.

Runs Anywhere: The entire website is in one file. You can open it on any computer without needing to install anything, which is perfect for a live demo.

3. Uploading Your Data
This feature makes the prototype work with your real data.

Simple File Processing: You can upload an Excel sheet, and the website will read the file right in your browser. This means you don't need a complex server or database to make it work.

Smart Sorting: The tool automatically sorts all the reviews from your Excel sheet into three groups: positive, negative, and neutral. This helps you quickly see what's working and what's not.

Instant Results: After you upload your file, the dashboard immediately updates with all the new data and visuals. You get a summary right away.
